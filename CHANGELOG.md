## 0.1.0 - First Release
* new colors
* re-formatted from earlier experiments for better organization
* _known issue:_ the editor window is badly mis-formatted on first launch. Changing to another theme and then back again fixes the issue.

## 0.1.1 - first GitHub push

## 0.1.2 - minor bug fix
* fixed a rendering bug that was very annoying.
